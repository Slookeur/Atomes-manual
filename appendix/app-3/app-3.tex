\chapter{The \aob{Library} in \atomes}
\label{lib}

The \atomes\ program includes a library with a number of molecules to be used when building or editing atomistic models: \\

\laf Available molecules can be found in the library by sorted in the following families: \\[0.5cm]
\begin{minipage}{5cm} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Misc
\item Alcohols
\item Aldehydes
\item Alkanes
\item Alkenes
\item Alkynes
\item Amides
\item Amines
\item Amino acids
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{5cm} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Aromatics
\item Carboxylic acids
\item Cyclic alkanes
\item Cyclic alkenes
\item Ethers
\item Fatty acids
\item Fullerenes
\item Heterocyclics
\item Macrocycles
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{5cm} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Ketones
\item Nitriles
\item Nucleobases
\item Steroids
\item Sugars (Linears)
\item Sugars (Cyclics)
\item Sulfoxides
\item Thiols
\end{itemize}

\noindent Each time a new molecule is selected in the tree view on the left side of the window (see figure~\ref{libinat}),
then the right side of the \aob{Library} dialog is refreshed with the data of the newly selected molecule. 
The data includes a 3D representation included in an active OpenGL window that allows to rotate the molecule: \\

\laf The data files that contain the information regarding each molecule in the library are located in the \aob{bin/library/molecules} directory. \\
To each molecule that appears in the \aob{Library} tree view, a file with the \aob{.sml} extension can be found in the corresponding family subfolder. \\
For the example in figure~\ref{libex}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The family is: \aob{Aromatics}
\item The molecule is: \aob{Caffeine}
\item The corresponding file is: \aob{Aromatics/caffeine.sml}. 
\end{itemize}
New files can be added to the library to be found by \atomes\ at startup, providing that the new files are added to one of the families of the library. 
These files must have the \aob{.sml} extension, follow the \aob{XML} encoding rules, and the following structure:
